## Hello World, I'm Zahrea 👋🏾

### Behind The Screen
Software Engineer and current Data Science Fellow with a B.S. in Computer Science from California State University, Sacramento. 

I build intuitive, data-driven applications that merge creativity, design, and analytical precision; also author of *The Stylish Scripts*, a Substack exploring fashion through data and machine learning.

### What I'm Learning 
• Expanding my technical expertise through The Knowledge House Innovation Fellowship, focusing on *data analysis*, *visualization*, and *predictive modeling*.

• Advancing my skills in Python, JavaScript, and SQL while exploring libraries and tools like pandas, Matplotlib, and Streamlit.

### In Development
• **Flourish Habit Tracker**: A habit-tracking app built with React that features a full CRUD layout for creating, editing, and managing habits. I’m currently integrating a data analytics dashboard using Python and Pandas to visualize progress trends and habit consistency through interactive charts and insights.

• **The Stylish Scripts**: A Substack series where I use data analytical tools and machine learning to analyze the intersection of data, design, and fashion.
