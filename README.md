## Hello World 👋🏾

### The Designer Behind The Screen
I'm Zahrea Franklin, a Software Engineer and current Data Science Fellow passionate about blending creativity with technology. I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from California State University, Sacramento, and specialize in building intuitive, data-driven applications that merge design thinking with analytical precision.

Outside of my development work, I run The Stylish Scripts, a Substack series where I use *Python*, *pandas*, and machine learning to analyze fashion trends, brand evolution, and cultural influence through data. It’s where my two worlds *style and science* meet in perfect symmetry.

### What I'm Learning 
• Expanding my technical expertise through The Knowledge House Innovation Fellowship, focusing on *data analysis*, *visualization*, and *predictive modeling*.
• Advancing my skills in Python, JavaScript, and SQL while exploring libraries and tools like pandas, Matplotlib, and Streamlit.
• Strengthening my understanding of statistical analysis and machine learning to design smarter systems.

### In Development
• **Flourish Habit Tracker**: A habit-tracking app built with React that features a full CRUD layout for creating, editing, and managing habits. I’m currently integrating a data analytics dashboard using Python and Pandas to visualize progress trends and habit consistency through interactive charts and insights.

• **The Stylish Scripts**: A Substack series where I use data analytical tools and machine learning to analyze the intersection of data, design, and fashion.
